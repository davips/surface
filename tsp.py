tsp.py: Construction and local optimization for the TSP.

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a combinatorial optimization
problem, where given a map (a set of cities and their positions), one
wants to find an order for visiting all the cities in such a way that
the travel distance is minimal.

This file contains a set of functions to illustrate:
  - construction heuristics for the TSP
  - improvement heuristics for a previously constructed solution
  - local search, and random-start local search.
